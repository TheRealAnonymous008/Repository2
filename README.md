PROJECT 1: MUSIC PLAYER

The following is a python program which plays music via Pygame and displays a spectrogram which updates as the music is playing. To make it into an application, compile Musicplayer.py using PyInstaller. To run and display music, ffmpeg is required. To play, place an mp3 or wav file in the same folder as the MusicPlayer.exe file.


PROJECT 2: RHYTHMIC AIM TRAINER

The following is a collection of files for making an aim trainer. Circles appear on screen and the player can click on these. The accuracy of the clicks (i.e. how far they are from the center is measured). Apart from the default mode, the user can also make their own beat maps (which determine the timing in which targets spawn but not their location on screen), and load beat maps they have made.
