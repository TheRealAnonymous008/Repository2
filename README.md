PROJECT 1: MUSIC PLAYER

The following is a python program which plays music via Pygame and displays a spectrogram which updates as the music is playing. To make it into an application, compile Musicplayer.py
using PyInstaller. To run and display music, ffmpeg is required. To play, place an mp3 or wav file in the same folder as the MusicPlayer.exe file.
